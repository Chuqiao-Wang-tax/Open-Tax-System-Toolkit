## Overview
Open-Tax is an AI-powered cloud platform transforming tax compliance through automated data integration, real-time anomaly detection, and multi-jurisdictional reconciliation. Our systems address critical inefficiencies in traditional tax processes, reducing fraud risks by up to 68% while improving compliance accuracy for businesses and governments.
